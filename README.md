# Mini Xcode Plugin

## Overview

This is a plugin that makes it easier to run Xcode without the main toolbar. It adds keyboard shortcuts for selecting the active scheme and device (`Ctrl`+`7` / `Ctrl` + `8`), and a compact popup menu in the window title bar that shows the currently selected run configuration.

While building a target, a circular spinner, the current progress (%) and all eventual errors, warnings and analyzer results are shown. 

You can disable the popup from the _View_ menu if you find it distracting, the keyboard shortcuts will also work without it. The popup is automatically hidden when the main toolbar is visible.

## Installation

Simply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. To uninstall, just remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

This is tested on OS X 10.8 with Xcode 4.4.1 and 4.5.0
